    "Monte Carlo is a city in Monacco where the famous Monte Carlo casino is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this, Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can generate a large number of uniformly distributed random points and plot them on the graph. These points can be in any position within the square i.e. between (0,0) and (1,1). We keep track of the total number of points, and the number of points that are inside the circle. If we divide the number of points within the circle,  𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑟 by the total number of points,  𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙, we should get a value that is an approximation of the ratio of the areas we calculated above,  𝜋/4\n"
